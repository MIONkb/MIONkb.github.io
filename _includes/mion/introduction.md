I am a Ph.D. student in Electronics Engineering (EE) at the State Key Laboratory of Integrated Circuits and System, Fudan University, supervised by Prof. [Lingli Wang](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/60/3c/c31155a352316/page.htm). My research focuses on **reconfigurable architectures (e.g. CGRAs)** and **AI compiler design**, with a particular emphasis on MLIR-based compilation frameworks, tensor dataflow optimization, and heterogeneous CGRA–CPU systems for AI workloads.

I have published papers at venues such as DATE 2024 and DAC 2025, and have participated in national and international competitions in electronic design and GPU programming. I also have internship experience at leading technology companies.

- Research Interests:
  - Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRAs)
  - Compiler design and MLIR-based compilation frameworks
  - LLM inference/training optimization on multi-GPU systems (parallelism, communication, scheduling)
  - AI deployment and dataflow-aware tensor optimization for DNNs
  - Polyhedral model and loop transformations
  - Heterogeneous accelerator–CPU systems and communication optimizations
